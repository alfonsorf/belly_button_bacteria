# Belly Button Bacteria

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's challenge was to help Roza publish her bacteria data in a clean dashboard that was interactive. In order to do so I learned more JavaScript and HTML concepts, and began using Plotly to create very sleek charts that would update with the criteria that was selected.
